Summary of the Notebook

This Google Colab notebook showcases the initial steps in an image classification project using the CIFAR-10 dataset and a neural network. The primary focus is on:

Dataset Loading and Exploration: The notebook begins by loading the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 60,000 color images categorized into 10 classes. It then proceeds to explore the dataset's structure, examining the shape of the training data, displaying sample images, and listing the associated class labels.
Data Preprocessing: Before model training, the notebook demonstrates the normalization of the image data. Each pixel value is divided by 255 to scale the pixel values to the range of 0 to 1, which is a standard practice for neural networks.
Model Definition: A basic neural network model is defined using Keras. This model consists of an input flattening layer, a hidden dense layer with ReLU activation, and an output dense layer with softmax activation to predict the class probabilities.
Visualization: The code includes the visualization of a training image, using matplotlib, to show how an image in the training set looks.
In essence, the notebook sets the foundation for a complete image classification project by:

Loading and preparing the CIFAR-10 dataset.
Defining a basic neural network architecture.
Visualizing the data and label.
What the notebook does NOT include:

Model training.
Model evaluation.
